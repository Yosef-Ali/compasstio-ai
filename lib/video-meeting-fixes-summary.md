# Video Meeting Fixes Summary

## üõ†Ô∏è Implemented Improvements

### 1. Self-View Fix
- Created a robust `SelfView` component that directly accesses browser's Media API to ensure your camera is always visible
- Enhanced `LocalVideoView` component with proper video stream lifecycle management
- Added proper cleanup handlers to prevent memory leaks and ensure camera resources are released
- Improved the participant rendering logic to always show local participant

### 2. Meeting ID Validation
- Improved the `validateMeeting` function in `/lib/api.ts` to handle multiple validation scenarios
- Added session storage tracking for newly created meetings to allow instant joining
- Better error handling for API responses during meeting creation and validation
- Special handling for mock meetings for easier testing

### 3. Error Recovery
- Added `VideoSDKInitializer` component that ensures VideoSDK constants are always available
- Implemented global error interception for VideoSDK-related errors 
- Created a centralized constants file (`/lib/constants.js`) to ensure consistent sidebar modes
- Enhanced wrapper functions for all VideoSDK hooks to provide fallbacks if errors occur

### 4. Resource Cleanup
- Improved track stopping when switching meetings or leaving video sessions
- Added proper cleanup of audio/video tracks with useEffect cleanup functions
- Ensured the app properly releases camera and microphone when they're no longer needed

### 5. Code Structure Improvements
- Separated concerns with clear component responsibilities
- Added better error logging throughout the video meeting flow
- Created reusable wrapper functions for VideoSDK hooks
- Improved prop handling between components

## üß™ Testing The Fixes

1. **Self-View Testing**:
   - Create a new meeting - you should now see yourself immediately when your camera is enabled
   - The view should remain stable and not disconnect unexpectedly

2. **Meeting ID Validation**:
   - Copy a meeting ID and try joining from another browser/device
   - The ID validation is now more robust and should work consistently
   - Newly created meetings can be joined immediately without validation errors

3. **Error Recovery Testing**:
   - If connection issues occur, the system will attempt to automatically reconnect
   - The improved error handling shows helpful messages instead of cryptic errors

4. **Resource Management**:
   - Your camera and microphone settings will be properly maintained between meetings
   - When leaving a meeting, camera and microphone resources are properly released
